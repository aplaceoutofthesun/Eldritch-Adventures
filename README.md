# Eldritch-Adventures
A small project for exploring the stories of Lovecraft.

Includes the file to download the text from 'http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/' then clean them. Bit of a work in progress. Some texts may be subject to copyright or other such issues, so caveat emptor...

Some of the files return empty when processed by the cleaning file. Not sure why; perhaps a formatting issue. Also, some of the texts have words that are joined together and need to be separated.

### TODO:
- Fix stuff that does not work
- Add further processing to the cleaning
